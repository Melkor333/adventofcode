My [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022) 2022 solutions in some poor C :)

# Specialities
## Pre Challenge 7

Reading a file, writing `unity` tests (copied the tests folder from a [exercism](exercism.org/) project.

## Challenge 7

Trying to use `#define`

## Challenge 8

No more tests. ~~Write function which takes another function as argument~~ Print out a nice map :)
And the first one with seemingly proper `typedefs`.
